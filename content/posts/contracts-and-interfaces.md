One of the most powerful concepts that I see arising all the time in programming and and all information systems is the idea of an interface. What I mean by an interface is a way of interacting with a system or object in a know and understoon way. Interfaces come in many forms like GUIs or object interfaces, APIs, written lanuages and physical afforadances. Exampes abound but the essesnce that all of these share is the underlying understanding that something is much more valuable if it is easy and to understand and make use of. Why because of a few reasons but most importantly it allows sharing and distributed innovation. It means that I don't have to reverse engineer the program to be able to extend it. It means that I can easily switch to the newer model of my washing machine since I don't have to learn how to use it or lose the investment I had before.

The antipatter of course is the naturally collary of this. If you can design something very useful but make it very hard to switch away from or extend in any way that you as producer are not in control of, you get to a very nice place of a localized monopoly until some can achieve some edge which then ruins you. This kind of thing has played out many times in history with winners and losers taking both paths, neither being a silver bullet but it seems that the interfaced approach does allow people who are willing to change and adapt to stay in the game as long as they do so.

This is a very interesting insight but not my main point. What I wanted to explore is the idea of interfaces and how to recognise the opportunity for them in new realms and to see if there is a way to think about the cost benifit trade-off for these. It is also known that developing good interfaces is rather difficult and requires much more effort and dedication than kepping it private. Given this fact can one develop the idea first and then generalize it after the fact into and interface once you have the undersanding of the requirements? If is there a model that one can use to determine when to switch from the one strategy to the other?

I have since my university days been attracted to the value of interfaces and well structured systems but these questions really started to develop after reading (this rant)[https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX] by Steve Yegge. Inparticular the effect that he described on the value and effectiveness of the systems built as platforms (using interfaces). 

Notes
-----

* First do a better job explaining what I mean by interfaces
* It could be cool to construct this post as a open question with the ideas and questions that I have
* Need to split out the questions and start offering some conclusions and ideas at least
