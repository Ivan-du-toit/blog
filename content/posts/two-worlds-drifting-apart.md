Recently with events like the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>&nbsp;persecution, SOPA, PIPA, wikileaks and Anonymous I have started to realize that worlds the technical and the non-technical and these worlds are drifting apart faster and faster. I use the word world because this is not just two groups of people, they are drastically different&nbsp;cultures that think, act and value everything differently.<br /><br />The problem that we are encountering is that most of the non-technical people are afraid of the other group. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Clarke's</a> third law so eloquently puts it:&nbsp;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. I totally agree with this statement, to me as a programmer the internet is magical, by even understanding how it works the sense of awe just increases.<br /><br />If you take this sense of magic about the technology and add the fact that&nbsp;Hollywood portrays programmers and scientist as people with super powers hacking systems in minutes and cracking all crypto systems with a snap of a finger, or solving the problems of science in their head while also saving the world as we know it.<br /><br />If I did not know better I would also be scared what will I a normal person do if these super being decide that they want to do something which is not according to societies norms? Who will stop them?<br /><br />Because of the overblown fear and lack of understanding
