Recently with events like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> persecution, SOPA, PIPA, wikileaks and Anonymous I have started to realize that worlds the technical and the non-technical and these worlds are drifting apart faster and faster. I use the word world because this is not just two groups of people, they are drastically different cultures that think, act and value everything differently.

The problem that we are encountering is that most of the non-technical people are afraid of the other group. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">Clarke's</a> third law so eloquently puts it: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. I totally agree with this statement, to me as a programmer the internet is magical, by even understanding how it works the sense of awe just increases.

If you take this sense of magic about the technology and add the fact that Hollywood portrays programmers and scientist as people with super powers hacking systems in minutes and cracking all crypto systems with a snap of a finger, or solving the problems of science in their head while also saving the world as we know it.

If I did not know better I would also be scared what will I a normal person do if these super being decide that they want to do something which is not according to societies norms? Who will stop them?

Because of the overblown fear and lack of understanding
