I have neglected my blog severely the past year and a half. I can offer many excuses but that does not matter. What matters is that I should be using it as I first intended - to document my thoughts and talk about things that I am thinking about as I live and learn.

Secondly to that I also want to improve my writing, which I just once again realized is so important no matter the endeavor one embarks on. This is doubly true if that pursuit is software development - which between you and me is not a profession for individuals whom shy away from social interaction and communication.

In order to accomplish these goals I have to make sure that I write often and with intent, not just when the planets align, the time allows and muses inspire (based on the abysmal lack of post during the last year this event is as likely as the event permutation suggests).

I am setting myself a goal to write a blog post every week. It does not have to be big or profound, I just have to write something of such quality that I am not ashamed to post it with my name attached.

I think this goal will challenge me but is achievable even during periods where I have a lot of other demands on my time as well. More importantly the challenge is structured in such a way that the&nbsp;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">"Don't break the chain,"</a> method of motivation can be applied which I recently found to be very effective in my use of the <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> app.

Thats it! My goal and first week described and started.
