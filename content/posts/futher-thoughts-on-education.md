Education does not cater to the requirements of society because academia likes to place topics in nice safe categories and teach those topics in a nice structured way. The problem with this is that most peoples require a vast array of cross disciplinary skills to do even simple jobs. You might then argue that the people should just take classes in all those areas and they will be set, but once more this is not the case as the integration of these separate ideas are difficult and situational. Therefore it is absolute necessity that education is appreciated in a more integrated way to show how one should approach the integration issues and to teach the students that in fact it is necessary and very rewarding to do so.<br /><br />Let us take and example that most of us have experienced, &nbsp;the very knowledgeable but horrible teacher. You can clearly see that the person is at the top of his or her field but she is just unable to communicate that expertise to the students in an effective way. Even if &nbsp;the lectures are trained better at communicating (if that is a problem) the difficult part of the process is the fact that the expert in a field has trouble seeing what the students could possibly have difficulty in understanding and it is also difficult to communicate the nuances of certain material without boring or confusing the student.<br /><br />As we can see even if we could train the teachers to be perfect the current system is broken because in essence training is not a linear process. You have a strange kind of circular dependency with both external material and material in the subject area which has to absorbed in an iterative approach. And this is exactly why the cross disciplinary teaching is also important because you sometimes get to view a certain method or piece of knowledge from different perspectives to iteratively gain a better insight. This also inherently leads to a more useful model that can be useful to accomplish your job and to better understand the next integrated area that you encounter.
