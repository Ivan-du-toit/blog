Please note that this is not your typical productivity guide or tips, I hate those, this is just some guidelines that I found useful in my everyday use of my computer to complete my work faster and with more fun - to get to the good parts :).<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><h2>This is not a productivity series.</h2><div>This title might seem weird but I have to explain why I find them grating and why this guide will be different. I hate normal productivity guides because of the focus and intent that I pick up on in them. It is to complete more work or get more money or get promoted. This seems like a great thing but not to me, these are no goals, they are means and if you make your means your goals you might never accomplish any meaningful goals because you are to focussed on the means. You are more than welcome to disagree with this view but that is the point of view that this series will be written in and because of that I must also state some of my other premises.</div><div><br /><h3>Premise 1:</h3>The use of my computer along with all of my job should be part of my enjoyment of life. This does not mean that everything I do should be fun and enjoyable but if most of want I am spending my life on is boring or depressing then I should make some serious life changes.<br /><br /><h3>Premise 2:</h3>Productivity is the means not the goal. Increasing my productivity is the means that I use to be able to spend more time on things that I enjoy.<br /><br /><h2>My approach to "Productivity".</h2></div><div>Choose where you optimize carefully</div><div><br /></div>Tip 1: Use your environments scripting language to automate small tasks.<br />Tip 2: Use learning software to adapt to your work style and workflow. <br />I don't think this tip style will work , I should rather divide the material into domains and do a domain per post.<br />Domains:<br />Applications launching.<br />Automating with scripts.<br />Responding to events.<br />Mention PsGet<br /><br />&nbsp;I would love to hear from anyone, in the comments, who found other useful tools and techniques.
