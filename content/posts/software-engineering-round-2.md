"No Battle plan survives first contact" - <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Helmuth von Moltke the Elder">Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</a><div><div><br /></div><div>This round was no different because I tried to implement a better workflow this time round with assigning of task and responsibilities to the&nbsp;group members. We also tried to make sure that all the members knew what software to use and had all the training to use them&nbsp;effectively and deadlines were also set more explicitly.</div><div><br /></div><div>That was what we set in motion at the start of the round. This strategy worked for the most part but a massive problem was that with the spreading out of task that each member completed on her own the overall result was not coherent at all. I have no idea how to change this. How should we with almost no meeting time &nbsp;and a very short turn around time (Monday to Thursday) get to a point where we have the same view on the task.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>What I did learn was that the things that I learned last week did make a difference and is very generic problems that one should look out for in all group work as it can make the group much more&nbsp;efficient.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Well maybe I will find a answer to this question in the next round...</div><div class="zemanta-pixie" style="height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"><a class="zemanta-pixie-a" href="http://www.zemanta.com/?px" title="Enhanced by Zemanta"><img alt="Enhanced by Zemanta" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_h.png?x-id=958f2458-b2d0-4140-b700-ca68d47f3d08" style="border: none; float: right;" /></a></div>
