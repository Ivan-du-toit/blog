<p>
This round was no different because I tried to implement a better workflow this time round with assigning of task and responsibilities to the group members. We also tried to make sure that all the members knew what software to use and had all the training to use them effectively and deadlines were also set more explicitly.
</p>

<p>
That was what we set in motion at the start of the round. This strategy worked for the most part but a massive problem was that with the spreading out of task that each member completed on her own the overall result was not coherent at all. I have no idea how to change this. How should we with almost no meeting time  and a very short turn around time (Monday to Thursday) get to a point where we have the same view on the task.
</p>

<p>
What I did learn was that the things that I learned last week did make a difference and is very generic problems that one should look out for in all group work as it can make the group much more efficient.
</p>

<p>Well maybe I will find a answer to this question in the next round...</p>
