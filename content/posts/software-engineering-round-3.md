This round had a rough start for me. First I had some problems getting in touch with my team members and then I could also not get access to our collaboration environment.

Luckily the other members of the team picked-up the slack and started on the work in a very Valve like style. With all the members doing pieces of work as they had time and opportunity. On Thursday I was able to at last get access and start to contribute so I did at least do my part even if it was not as much as I would have liked.

From this experience I learned that with some teams it is better to have a much more hands off approach I believe that if this team was managed more aggressively that the result of the work would not be as good. This is the opposite of what I saw in the first round. I take form this that it is very important to change you leadership style from team to team to really get the most out of all the people you work with.

I also think that the team <a href="http://www.belbin.com/" target="_blank">roles</a> theory that Vreda talked about is really valuable. If you can identify the roles that people would like to take on and help them to be effective in those roles you could make the team much more effective. I think that I should try and train myself to identify those roles in people within a short time so that I can interact with them better.

In this round the lessons is much more meta but I think that the impact that they can have on me and team I work in can be very profound.
