<p>This might be a strange thing to confess but up until now I did not think of my self as one. Yeah sure sometimes I don't start one things that I need to do as early as possible or I stay up late playing games or watching movies/series. But I was one of the students that always started the assignments first. I am the one that -<p>
<p>No! Stop it. Don't think about all the exceptions that you can find. Of all the times when you had oodles of will power and a drive to complete that task. When everything else in your life was going well and you could just focus on that one thing. That is not helpful, life does not look like that most of the time, so stop pretending that is what you are like most of the time.</p>
<p>Most of the time you are tired, with your focus split into a thousand shards. You struggle to split the little drive and will power that you have between the at least five lifetimes worth of things that you want to do, or think will be fun to master. That is beyond the normal obligations that you also have to keep track of and fulfil to the best of your abilities. Then the obligations also have a habit of making it easy to bury yourself in them because it is more clear how to proceed and feel like you are making progress.</p>
<p>But are you?</p>
<p>Sometimes you are lucky. You take the right fight, you ride the wave of energy and all the stars align once again giving you the counter point to put to bed the suspicion that you might be a procrastinator. It is an illusion and that is all, take off the blinkers and take in your life as a whole.</p>
<p>Wow this got dark!</p>
<p>When you are confronted with a certain realization that has a big effect on you life it has the possibility to be dark and depress but it should not. You should celebrate this as victory, the revelation of the enlightening. The start of the change that can be achieved with knowledge, persistence and handwork.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>To move forward and take control of this invisible monkey on your back:<p>
<ol>
    <li>You need to form better habits.</li>
    <li>You need to set yourself proper goals based on what you want to achieve</li>
    <ol>
        <li>You then need to start aligning the things that you focus on, to the above goals</li>
    </ol>
    <li>You need to understand first and foremost why you procrastinate.</li>
</ol>

The answers to these questions don't have to be the constant. Change is good but keep the focus on where you want to go not just your fancy at some point in time. Endurance is key.
