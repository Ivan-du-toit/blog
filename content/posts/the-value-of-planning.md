<div dir="ltr">Ok so now that I have confronted my self about my procrastination (I catch my self doing it now all the time, but I know that knowledge of a problem is already great big step) and I have sorted out my priorities - this is more of a never ending work in progress. I have come to realize that there is one more crucial thing that I am missing and which I am not very good at.</div><div dir="ltr">Planning</div><div dir="ltr">Planning is such an important part of getting things done especially if you are like me. I like a hyper active dog on redbull, chasing after every squirrel of a new idea/opportunity that interests me - a.k.a just about everything.</div><div dir="ltr">I watched this video which speaks about this where Warren Buffet might or might not have given some interesting advice on this topic.</div><div dir="ltr">Back to the point of planning. In simple terms planning makes it easy to get a lot done. That is in essence it. </div>
