<p>It is not about which extreme you should use. It is allways having the wisdom to know when which of the extremes are nessary and should be used. For the masters of self analysis and clear thought you can also take it futher and use just the right balance of the one extreme or the other. </p><p>I think this idea that we see someone being succesfull and then giving a certain attribute that was useful in that situation this high reverence is one of the reasons that we can learn and grow and actually become wiser.</p>
