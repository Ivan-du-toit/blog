Yes as a programmer I am stereotypically obliged to have my first post greet the virtual world in this fashion (I don’t think many “Real People” will be reading this so I dedicate this post to those programmer friendly web crawlers out there ). I hope that after this I will fall into this trap too often and bore anyone that has the misfortune to stumble upon this blog.<br /><h4>The Goal</h4>The goal of this blog is threefold: <br /><ul><li>For me to gain experience in communication (OK I know that is another stereotype, this might be harder than I thought).&nbsp;</li><li>To keep an archive of&nbsp;thoughts&nbsp;and interests that I come across.&nbsp;</li><li>And (might I be so vain)  help someone with a problem or piece of code that I too have struggled with and found an answer to.&nbsp;</li></ul><br />I don’t know how this is going to work but here we go down the rabbit hole.
