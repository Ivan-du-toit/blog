Yes as a programmer I am stereotypically obliged to have my first post greet the virtual world in this fashion (I don’t think many “Real People” will be reading this so I dedicate this post to those programmer friendly web crawlers out there ). I hope that after this I will fall into this trap too often and bore anyone that has the misfortune to stumble upon this blog.
<h4>The Goal</h4>
The goal of this blog is threefold:
<ul>
    <li>For me to gain experience in communication (OK I know that is another stereotype, this might be harder than I thought).</li>
    <li>To keep an archive of thoughts and interests that I come across.</li>
    <li>And (might I be so vain)  help someone with a problem or piece of code that I too have struggled with and found an answer to.</li>
</ul>
I don’t know how this is going to work but here we go down the rabbit hole.
