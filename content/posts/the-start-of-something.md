The start
---------

Yeah I know I have said this kind of thing before but let me tell you what I did then we can talk about what I intend.

Today I started to learning about React and Flux from first principles. So what did I learn? Well I got to install a bunch of things and learned about RequireJs, npm, and immutableJS including [this very cool talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7IdS-PbEgI). I also played around and became for familiar with the constraints in Ubuntu Bash for windows and fish shell.

Today was again a warning/show of force for rabbit holing, since I was not able to get very far into [this tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) having just installed the test dependencies. But I am happy with what I did since I really dug into the sections that I did not know and generally broaden my horizons.

This will give the productivity gurus a fit but, I think that this kind of exploration and free deep exploration is something that is missing for me at the moment and I am poorer for it. At work I have very tight deadlines and certain decisions are out of my hands at the moment so this approach is off the table. But here in my own time I don't have a deadline and I should celebrate that.

A word of warning to my future self - this is not a get out of jail free card to not complete things or to get distracted by the latest shiny thing. No, I have q few ideas and technical areas that I want to explore while having fun and maybe producing something useful along the way.

Anyway I would like to write little updates on the progress and what I learn along the way in this style which I expect won't be much use for anyone but me if that.

What I learned
--------------

I am really interested in the concept of immutability and the impact that could have on the complexity of applications. I really enjoyed and resonated with the Rich.

Future reading
--------------
I want to read up about the people mention in that ImmutableJS talk
* J.C.R Licklider - Just in general and review what I know about Tries.
* Alan Kay - His views on OOP and what the intent is and how that fits with modern patterns and design
* Phil Bagwell - "Ideal Hash Trees, 2000"
* Rich Hickey - I really liked his talk about [Simple Made Easy, 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0) and which I would like to explore more.
