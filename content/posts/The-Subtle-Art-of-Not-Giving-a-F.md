TL;DR
=====
Be careful about what you care about since you only have a finite amount of time/caring to give. Focus and care about things that align with your personal values and which delivers on your legacy. Happiness is the result of caring about something bigger than yourself.

Chapter take aways
==================

Chapter 1: Don't try
--------------

- The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience and, paradoxically the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience
- Be careful for the feedback loop from hell: Because you feel bad, and you think you should not, you feel worse which is bad and makes you feel bad...
- Not caring about the outcome many times makes you more successfull,
- It is about choosing carefully what to care about in your life
- You can't be an important and life changing presence for some people without being a joke and an embarrassment to others.

**Subtlety #1**
Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different

**Subtlety #2**
To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity

**Subtlety #3**
Whether you realize or not you are always choosing what to give a fuck about

Chapter 2: Happiness is a problem
---------------------------------

- Suffering without purpose does not bring meaning or value
- All life is suffering because of plenty or because or Scarcity
- Not all suffering is equal though
- The solution too one problem is just a slightly better problem, the world will never be perfect
- Emotions are like pain they are feedback on what is good or bad for us
- Emotions are sign posts not commandments, in fact we should make a habit of questioning them
- What creates our positive experiences defines our negative experiences
- Choose your struggel: what pain do you want in your life?
- You are defined by what you are willing to struggle for

Chapter 3: You are not special
------------------------

- Everyone can't be exceptional so statistically you aren't.
- Even if you are your are not in all things
- People now tend to rather be at the low end of the bell curve than the middle because that is more exceptional than average

Chapter 4: The value of suffering
---------------------------

- The self-awareness onion:
    1. Understanding one's emotions
    2. Understanding why you have the emotions
    3. Understanding our personal values, why do I consider this a failure or not?
- If we choose our values poorly all the decisions we make will be out of whack
- Values that get you into trouble
    - Pleasure: it is fleeting and does not sustain
    - Material things: it creates a never ending treadmill that you have to keep fuleing
    - Being right: you are not perfect you will get it wrong, don't setup yourself for constant failure
    - Staying positive: life sucks sometimes it is healthy to acknowledge that. Doing so is avoidance
- Good values are:
    - Reality based
    - Socially constructive
    - Immediate and controllable
- Bad values are:
    - Superstitious
    - Socially destructive
    - Not immediate and controllable

Chapter 5: You are always choosing
-------------

- You can't control what happens to you but you can control how you react to it.
- Even if we have no choice in the matter, a tragedy in our life) we still choose how to deal with that and what we can take away.

Chapter 6: Your are wrong about everything
------------------------------------------

**Manson's law of avoidance**

> The more something threatens your identity the more you will avoid it.

- We have to be able to be wrong to be able to grow.
- Growth and therefore being wrong is an important part of our life
- Growth is an iterative process where we go from wrong to slightly less wrong, not perfect {{< note >}} Is there a distinction between this description and gaining nuance? Maybe we are more generally correct but not fully general vs wrong and right? {{</ note >}}
- All our beliefs are wrong, some are just less wrong than others {{< note >}} Assuming this is true why would that be? How do you prove that it is all our beliefs and not just some classes of our beliefs? I don't understand the basis for this claim and the resulting world view. I am happy to go along with: "All our beliefs could be wrong, and we should be prepared to accept that" {{</ note >}}
- Since our minds, memories and emotions are not always right we should question ourselves all the time
- Knowing yourself means that you have fixed your identity, meaning that you will avoid situations where that is proved wrong. Thus it is dangerous to know yourself {{< note >}}The premise here seems to be that avoidance or not going to certain experiences is bad. I don't quite know what that is based on? Why is avoiding painful experiences not sometimes good? {{</ note >}} {{< note >}}Can this identity not rather be viewed as a guide or autopilot? I can override my identity at any time. Sure it takes effort and time but is not beyond you. This then means you can focus your attention on other things that you want to give a fuck about? {{</ note >}}
- How to breed uncertainty in your life:
    - What if I am wrong?
    - What would it mean if I am wrong?
    - Would being wrong create a better or worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?
- If you have to choose between you being wrong or everyone else being wrong it is probably you

Chapter 7: Failure is the way forward
-------------------------------

- We can only be truly successful at something if we are willing to fail at it
- It is growth that generates happiness not a long list of achievements
- When you choose a new value, you choose a new pain, learn to sustain it and act despite it.
- If you are stuck with a problem, don't just think about it, start working on it, the ideas will come
- Action isn't just the effect of motivation it's also the cause

Chapter 8: The importance of saying no
--------------------------------------

- The only way to create meaning in your life is by rejecting alternatives
- To value x you have to reject non-x; therefor rejection is good {{< note >}}I don't quite understand how this applies to all cases. If the choice is mutually exclusive yes but that is not the case in a vast number of situations. This value seems more of a collolory of having values and living by them. {{</ note >}}
 {{< note >}} This also leads me to think about optionality and how that works here. I have to assume that this advice applies in the case of having to narrow to one option. Where trying to keep hanging on to the perceived optionality is a false path {{</ note >}}
- Romeo and Juliet is a warning not a romantic ideal
- The difference between a healthy and unhealthy relationship
    - How well each person accepts responsibility
    - The willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner
- The help and support should be voluntary given and accepted
- Commitment gives you freedom because you are no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous.
- Commitment allows you to focus intently

Chapter 9: And then you die
---------------------------

- Humans have the unique ability to imagine their own death
- The terror of this underlies all our thoughts and actions
    - This seems really strange
- We have two parts physical and conceptual, we try keep living on after physical death by extending our conceptual self via lasting impact, e.g. Books, politics, family ect
- We need to accept our death so we can be free from its terror allowing us to care about the right things
- Happiness comes from caring about something bigger than yourself
