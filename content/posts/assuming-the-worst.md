I read <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" target="_blank">this</a> post at some point which had a great influence on my thinking since then. Recently I started to think about the how this fits into normal social interaction which I think is a very adaptive experience.

Let me explain what I mean by that. I believe that people are driven to learn different things because of rewards that they value. This happens at a very low subconscious level. A person that highly values other people, their interaction and opinions are more likely to be very good in social interactions than a person that values technical correctness for example. This is natural because most areas of life and thinking we have to compromise on sets of ideas and ideals that we like or believe in, but which can't co-exist in harmony. So we have to choose to give preference to the one or the other in certain situations.

<h2>An example and analysis</h2>
Let me demonstrate with an example. As part of a group conversation someone says "There is no gravity in space". I would then reply explaining that there is gravity in space. In fact there is an attraction between any two objects and there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation">formula</a> which expresses this force as it relates to mass and distance. This is a pretty natural flow of conversation for me but not for most other people.

Lets see what the result of this flow of conversion is: I feel better because I corrected the false statement thereby making sure that both the person that said it has a better understanding of the concept of gravity and physics, as well as giving the rest of the group a refresher. On the other hand the author of the statement has a very different reaction. He feels failure, ridicule or at the very least diminished. I don't believe that he should feel that way but that is separate discussion and is not the way most situations play out so it is not relevant to this discussion.

On balance my comment was very damaging and probably did not make me a friend. Yet I did not mean to insult but only to inform. You could even argue that I saved him future embarrassment. Now only this group believes that he did not understand gravity. Where as if he went uncorrected he could have stated this false premise to more people who then also by social convention does not correct him but knows that he does not know.

To provide another example - I would much rather have the first person to sees that I have my fly open tell me about it so only one person notices instead of saving me that embarrassment of telling me and letting everyone see, until I notice myself, since I will assume that everyone saw anyway.

Regardless what I think is the best course of action, social convention dictates that I embarrassed him and should therefore be avoided or embarrassed in return to save face. With all of this machinery in place we can easily see that we now have two options.
<ol>
    <li>Correct the person and lose social standing and friends (not all at once but little by little.)</li>
    <li>Let the false statement stand and be more acceptable to more people thereby gaining more friends and acquaintance and being a generally more likable fellow.</li>
</ol>

I know I am glossing over other things that impact the equation like context, delivery, body language etcetera, but those only amplify or dampen the effect that the basic options offer.

<h2>The trade-off</h2>
This is where your personal valuation of a certain ideal or attribute comes into play. If it is important to you to be friendly to everyone or most people you would rather not correct someone when they say something that you do not agree with, but if you value correctness more you will want to. With some training we are taught when we should override our default actions when it would not be beneficial in the long term. That is what we call manners or etiquette, manners are good because it allows for a social interaction that leaves both parties more satisfied and hopefully richer for the interaction.

Some other social lubricant that we use is we try to think how what we think or say will affect the other person. This is a very natural extension of our brains as predictions machines and serves us well. The problem is that it is very expensive and we don't always have a lot of information to use in our predictions. To overcome these problems we use a very power full technique called generalization. This technique allows us to model people, object and events with composition of known models and examples and from there extrapolate the expected behaviour from the known models into our novel situation at a low cost, high speed and acceptable accuracy.

<h2>But generalization is bad</h2>
OK that sounds great but in the linked post it was demonstrated that it is a bad idea to generalize from one example, which argument is then correct? Surprisingly or maybe not both are correct. Like with most things contexts is such an important part of the equation but is missed so often. There are situations that this technique serves very well but it can also go wrong. So now that we know that our brains are doing this we can think about the impact of getting this wrong and we can act accordingly by either first validating our extrapolations or by making sure that the impact of getting it wrong is small.

For the first part I can not offer you any generalization that you could apply to validate your model. It is too context dependent, but if you practice you will get better at it. The second part is what interests me because I think that we as a society is actively sabotaging our social interactions and our emotions by magnifying the impact of the wrong extrapolations. Let me give you an example: If I ask a girl "Have you lost some weight?"; this sentence can be interpreted in any number of ways with different contexts and intentions. It could just mean that I noticed that she looks great and told her that, or I could have implied that she was fat, to name just 2 of the many possible interpretations.

Because we humans are social creatures that get some of our identity from those around us and because most people are not that secure in their self image we assume or at least think about the most negative implication; Please note that this is not always true, again the context plays a big part. Assuming the worst leads to a less satisfactory social interaction and benefit for both parties. The historic reason we needed to know if someone was hostile to us was to keep us from being killed but since we have a slightly more forgiving climate.

Therefore I think that we should teach and train ourselves (because this is sometimes a subconscious reaction) to always assume the most positive implication. This means that we have a better self image and social interaction and better understanding between people. I think that by changing the default like this would remove so much animosity between people especially when something like race, gender or creed is involved.

As a last though I encourage you to actively try and understand why and how you do ordinary things you do because if we understand why we do things we will be much more equipped to changed those "instincts" that have a valid place and use in context and how to switch them off when we recognize a non-optimal context instead of demonizing all of these tools outright because of some of the problems that might arise from using or abusing them in the wrong context.
