Post:
The style of blog is limiting in my mind I want to start writing about an idea or though and feel free to publish it as just that: "The germ of an idea full of questions and unexplored content". I then want to come back and update these ideas later. I think that it still makes sense to have the cotent in chrono order but maybe by update date instead of publish date.

History would be important to show where the idea came from (each page/post could have a github link to the content history for easy exploration) It would also be important to somehow show updates or revisions. (I am not sure how I want to do this. You don't want to layer to much on top if the cotent but have it easily found if that is of interest. Maybe a javascript plugin that pulls the revision data from github and optionally overlays it with some kind of indecator!)

How to think about selling yourself. You don't want to bore people and piss them off and I like the certain aspect of mistery but I also think that it is important for myself and others to know what I have done at work and not make just do the things and forget about it. I think it will then also make it much easier for me to reflect and praise other people how helped and contributed if I know that I will remember and that there is some record of the what happend.

The bigger question does come to mind why should I do this at all? Am I currently limited in what I can do? DO I just want more money? Do I have to do this? I can see that people around me succeed in certain things by doing this but what are they giving up? What is it that I value and want to get out of my work and labour?

I think that people hate it if the reflection is fake or seem fake or intended to decieve. You should never think or act to seem like a conman (sales people). It should be real and authentic.

Idea:
How do scale education? If we have to contend with all of these scaling factors at work how do we continue to learn and know about the best way to do things? I don't think we have a great system. I think one of the first steps is Just in Time learning. So creating solutions that teach you about a situation just before or during a situation. 

What does this mean? Well I know this is condecending but I think it has value to think of this as a crutch or training wheels while you are learning to ride a bicycle. It helps and it shows you what you should be aiming for. It also allows you to make mistakes as long as they are not catastrophic. In the same way I think you could start thinking about tools to help engineers and customers use the tools and train them in best practices. But The barrier to entry for both contributing and for learning and using should be supper low. 

I think there are many things that you still have to think about and correct as something like this is built and tested but we really need to start solving this problem reading a bunch of docs or a series of training or vidoes are nice but they are diffuclt to find and you never know if they are still applicalable or which parts are applicable to you.

Thinking of our operational work we could implement a grease monkey script that reminds you to communicate in the ticket. Or that analyses you your ticket queue and suggests links and materials based on what you queue looks like. The learning and knowledge is captured in the code which makes indexing easier. Or at least provides one more index to use to find the knowledge that you require.

Idea:
Publish my notes on things I learn. Call the series or category Finally: {Skill, Project or subject}. Finally posts should not be final and should be the summaries of the learnings that I have coalliated to far. They should be expected to change and evolve. I should not be afraid to write questions or half formed thoughts in finally posts.

I Should also write a post explaining the idea behind these posts and link to that from each of the posts.
