My name is Ivan du Toit, I was born...

No none of that will tell you much about me and I bet neither will anything I write on this page. So let it be enough to know this:

<h3>I ponder</h3>
Some of which I write about here.

<h3>I love</h3>
Most of which I will not write about here.

<h3>I share</h3>
Which is partly the reason this site exists. For more read [this]({{< ref "hello-world.md" >}})

If this is not enough for you to sample the pudding that is this site I bid thee farewell and wish you well in your
travels through the experience that is this wonderful web which this site calls home.

Everything I write here is my opinion and not those of my employer or any other entity that I may be affiliated with.

-Ivan
