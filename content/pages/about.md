My name is Ivan du Toit, I was born...

No none of that will tell you much about me and I bet neither will anything I write on this page. So let it be enough to know this:

<h3>I ponder</h3>
Some of which I write about here.

<h3>I love</h3>
Most of which I will not write about here.

<h3>I share</h3>
Which is partly the reason this site exists.

The reason for this sites existence are outlined [here]({{< ref "hello-world.md" >}})

If this is not enough for you to sample the pudding that is this site I bid thee farewell and wish you well in your
travels through the thoughts and experience that is this wonderful web that this site calls home.

-Ivan
